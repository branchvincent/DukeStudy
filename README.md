# README for DukeStudy Application
DukeStudy is an application to help Duke students find study groups. This is the readme for the DukeStudy Application V1. In this version, the basic User Interface as well as basic database read and write functionality is implemented.
### Installation Instructions
This project should be imported into Android Studio. This was tested with the Nexus 5 emulator API 24: 5554.

### Completed Tasks
All tasks listed in our Sprint 1 Plan were completed.

1) Side Navigation Bar: The side naviagtion bar was completed. It is a hideable as described in the plan. All of the options have basic functionality. 

2) Top Bar Naviation: The top bar navigation page template was completed and can be seen by clicking on groups or one of the sample courses. Note that these tabs each read dummy data from our database.

3) Profile Page: A profile page was implemented. This can be seen by clicking on the Profile option in the navigation bar. The name field is editable by clicking the edit button.

4) Course Page: Example course pages can be in "Classes" subsection. There are 3 sample courses. These have the 3 tab top navigation bar implemented in (3). The tabs read dummy data from the database.

5) Add Course Page: This can be seen be clicking on the "Add Class" option in the side navigation bar. This reads a dummy list of classes from the database.

6) Groups Page: This can be seen by clicking on the "Groups" option on the side navigation bar. The top bar navigation is again used and dummy data is read from the database.

7) Navigation Integration: Navigation integration was performed as all of the side navigation bar options direct to appropriate pages.

8) Database setup: An example for reading from and writing to the database can be seen by selecting the "Firebase Ex" option. Values in the database are written to a list. This list is updated when new values are added to the database. This can be tested by typing in the text field and pressing "SUBMIT".

We also completed a dummy sign-in page. Any text can be entered in username or password and the sign-in button wll take you to the main page of the application. This will eventually communicatie with the firebase authentication module.
